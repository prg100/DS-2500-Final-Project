However, Instead of giving up on the game the devs decided to listen to the criticism and add to it.

Exploration becomes stale and unexciting after the first system or two. Planets, fauna, and flora end up all acting and looking nearly identical, despite being hundreds of star systems apart. Base building is fun but entirely inefficient and unfulfilling aside from storing items. Economy is pointless and easily exploited. Ruins, wrecks, and distress signals are unrewarding and lack any substance aside from material gain. Star-ships suffer a similar plague to the animals and plants, being that they all end up looking, feeling, and doing the same thing but have a different color or cockpit style. They're fun to collect, but with lack of both cosmetic and non-cosmetic customization and personalization, it's frustrating to wade in such an in-depth concept when it's stuck at such a shallow level.

What should be a reward for the curiosity of the player instead becomes 300 credits for ""discovering"" the exact same flower you've seen on the last three planets but happens to be of a different name. Plainly, there just isn't enough variation to overcome its platitudinous nature. With procedural generation being the culprit and the core of NMS, it is hard to overlook how glaringly bland the ""discovery"" aspect of this game still remains, five years later. The updates that Hello Games has released within the last couple of years are definitely interesting and exciting; doubtless, they are good content. However, the problem lies with the fact that these updates are great DLC additions to an average game, which hinders you from enjoying the newer content to the fullest extent due to the underlying game being lackluster. A car with the most exotic, most thrilling, and most beautiful of body designs amounts to nothing if the engine is insipid and problematic. 

I have nothing but respect for Hello Games and their ""actions>words"" mentality and approach. Maybe one day, they will give No Man's Sky the deep rethinking that it desperately needs to achieve what they first envisioned. Until then though, aside from a decent and aesthetically pleasing time waster, I cannot recommend NMS if you're looking for the ultimate space exploration experience that we all believed it would be.",0,0,13,0.736209750175476074,37,True,False,False

I bought this game around the NEXT update, the first major overhaul to the game, right around when the reviews started shifting towards positive, and I enjoyed it a lot. To be honest, I thought I'd seen everything No Man's Sky had to offer.

I was completely wrong.

To be honest, I've completely lost count of the updates that Hello Games has launched over the years. The amount of content that's being added into the game FIVE years into its release is staggering. You can now explore a crashed freighter, create hubworlds for players to visit, start an MMO-like journey called ""Expedition"" mode with other players, which itself is a completely different gamemode than co-op.
We've also gotten several major graphical overhauls, new planet terrain generation and planet types, different star formations and a galactic trade network, and not to mention that VR-mode is INCLUDED, not considered a separate game. 

I wouldn't be surprised if this game was mistaken to be brand-new, because it sure feels like it is. If you want a huge, open-world survival experience, where you can leave after you've seen everything and come back 6 months later to somewhere between 2 and 3 updates, I'd recommend No Man's Sky.

As one of the players from the release date of the game years ago, experiencing lots of ""ups and downs"" with this game... In its current state however with all the free updates and continued development over the years, if the game is [ON SALE] and you might enjoy it, then why not give it a shot!



---[Review]---

Being there playing release VS its current state is crazy to think about (50% Unplayable, save corruptions and extreme amount of missing content...
However this is now the game that was hoped for looking back at what they said should be in the game unfortunately it took a very long time to get here! 

What you'll find now is a decent game, Its not a ground breaking title by today's standards but its one to remember. There's plenty to have a go at if you enjoy exploring for the sake of it, I tend to find No Mans Sky relaxing with a bit of spiciness thrown in occasionally but there are a few things that might feel a bit repetitive for most players the longer one plays...

However being able to go solo then drop in at any time to a friend is great!

I would imagine not everyone will enjoy this game, but on the other hand many still could in its current updated state.

Will admit though the standard price of $80 AUD is extremely high, as lets be serious, its a older release now (late 2016) and its had its challenges in the past... Would strongly suggest picking up ON SALE! 
As of current review (6/4/2021) the game is half the price above, a lot more sensible.

Anyways playing it again, I'm enjoying it so decided to finally review it 5 years later ahaha.


NB: Thankfully the dev team has kept determined working on it, updating and adding large chunks of gameplay rather than ditching development and diving away from No Mans Sky!",1,6,0,0.603866636753082275,0,True,False,False

NMS is basically space Minecraft, focusing a bit more on exploration. Would recommend if you like sandbox and exploration.  

Since the map is procedurally generated, most of the planets can feel a bit shallow. I've encountered a few bugs here and there, though some of them can be game-breaking (terrain magically growing back, softlock quest). Not sure if it's fixed by now. ",1,4,0,0.572076916694641113,0,True,False,False
12,76561198128235014,87,11,641,638," No Man’s Sky has come a long way since it was first announced and released. It started out as a basic space game with limited gameplay. It has since become a much better game. It is mostly as open world space game (PVE) with some co-op. Since the original release, the game has improved significantly. They have flushed out the “story” and main quest line. Added base building and economy. The game has a decent amount of replay ability. 
This game is very progression based. Once you finally complete all the objectives, build all the bases you wanted, explored lots of planets, it can become stale. This fact is overshadowed, however by the updates to the game that add more content. These updates decrease this problem significantly. 
Overall, this game is very polished and feels mostly complete. The planets and biomes look stunning and full of life on earthly planets and completely dead on others. There is a wide variety of places you can go with little restriction. You can even name planets and solar systems! This game has risen to my favorite space game overall. 

Pros: 
-Interesting worlds and biomes promote exploration
- Objectives teach you how to play the game 
-Easy to learn 
-Crafting items and mining are fun and easy to do
-Local economy makes mining interesting 
-Based building allows you to make a variety of builds
-Easy and stable to run (ran on nividia 1060 and got 100+ fps)
-no DLC (everything in base game) 
-no microtransactions

Cons: 
-Heavily progression based (once you complete everything, explore enough, get all ships: it can get stale)
-gameplay is a bit repetitive (when mining) 
-early mining and inventory management are challenging
-low amount of combat 

TL:DR If you are looking for a space game this is it. It is similar to space engineers, but simpler and easier to understand. A beautiful game to look at and co-op is not forced on the player. Overall, a great game and I highly recommend you play it. However, I would recommend waiting for a sale as $60 is a bit steep for a 1- year old game.

 -Death happens, and like Minecraft, you respawn and grab your stuff back and get back to it
 -You are not the top of the food chain (Sentinels and certain animals exist)
 -The wiki and in-game database will be ultimately be the difference in rage-quiting early or enjoying this game
 -This game is all about exploration, the more you explore the more fun, and calming (in a way) this game will feel

Do you yearn for exploration? When you play a new game, do you canvas the entire map looking for interesting things? Do you only get a dopamine rush from seeing something in a game that you have never seen before?

If you said yes to these questions, then this game is perfect for you.

The early game is a little rough, but once you get a decent amount of income, the game really opens up with the amount of things you are able to do.

My main gameplay tips:
- You should try to finish the first part of the main story as quickly as possible, because it opens up a lot of the other mechanics in the game.
- Get a lot of salvaged data and make a base with unlocked parts as soon as possible. Having a base will let you dig for deep mineral deposits or farm, which can quickly make you A LOT of money.
- Upgrade your scanner on your multitool with three S-class upgrades. Doing this, if you're lucky with the upgrade rolls, can mean that scanning a single new creature on a planet will give you ~500,000 units in one go.
- Try to mostly visit systems that have a three-star economy. You can buy and sell goods for better prices there, you will get more valuable ships there, and potentially more valuable multitools.
- Because this game can seem pointless if viewed from a big picture perspective, try to alternate what you do every time you play. One day you can set up a deep mineral extraction mine, the next day clear out some desolate freighters, the next day talk to a bunch of Korvax to fill out your lexicon, the next day fly around looking for a better ship, etc. This way you won't get bored, at least not until you hit 200+ hours.

I'll end by saying that this game is not for everyone. Hell, I take months-long breaks from it and return once in a while to try out new content and do some relaxing exploration.

I wrote a negative review during this process, which got deleted midway through after steam crashed trying to launch no mans sky. But when I was finally able to relaunch the game, ready to quit after all my progress getting sunk in the ground, I decided to just build a new, bigger base in the sky, away from all possibility of game breaking terrain bugs. I relocated ALL of my things to the new base, just so I could continue playing. This game has a way of reeling you in like nothing else I've ever played, there's so much to do and explore, and the constant free update support for the game compels me to leave a positive review rather than a negative one.

I had played for roughly 60 hours before putting it back on the virtual shelf. Back then the game was beautiful.

I just picked it up to play something new, and different. I was bored out of my mind when I played the initial release, and shelved it for a little while.

We all know the NMS story from there. 

NMS after Hello Games put some more work into her went from bland, and boring to ""pretty damn good"". The addition of a ""story"" helped. When i replayed NMS after a few content updates, I actually grinded it out to complete the story. It seemed the more content Hello Games put into NMS the better it became.

The good:  It's pretty. For the most part NMS has some good eye candy. Game play is simple, but immersive enough. For me when i play i just want to kick back, and enjoy the views. Base building can be fun. Creative mode is there for those that hate grinding. For the most part i just free roam. Once you get a decent enough ship, and suit upgrades you pretty much are not bound by anything.

The Bad: Things can get repetitive at times. Especially while questing, and mining. As i said, The game play is simple. Usual fetch this, or kill that quests. On top of grinding to improve your ship, and suit. Some effects break immersion. I get that its randomly generated, but it suffers sometimes from Homeworlds ""Space is Yellow"". Don't get me started on the hyperspace effect. Good thing there are mods that fix this.

Depending on the game mode you opt for, starting off can be a challenge whilst you establish yourself and your supplies. Once over this, the game transcends into chill-vibe exploration survival game. Become allies or enemies with any or all of the three main alien races, find your perfect unique starship, build your own base, adopt wild animals, race against friends in your exocrafts, the list goes on.

This game allows it to play it as you please. If you want to be an explorer, you are rewarded. If you want to be a bounty hunter, you are rewarded, etc. Anything you do in the game progresses you forward in a very entertaining way. I am fairly early game, but it feels like a very complete game already.
The bad:
Glitches are not rare. Note that I do not say they are frequent or common. You're able to go down some story lines without completing the one that comes before it, leading to you getting half way through the new story and you cannot complete it because it just stops functioning properly due to not having completed prior parts. In addition, I have had a base in a location for some time, collecting resources from the area frequently. At some point, the trees decided that they were only present in a visible form that you can walk through and cannot use a mining laser on.
Summary:
There are few but occasional glitches in the game, one that I have encountered being game altering. This game always has a mission for you to do and missions often cross over into each other, giving you a dynamic experience that allows you to discover multiple things in a single mission so that you are never left underwhelmed or bored with the trip.

there are bugs but very well made game if you like the following: 

Minecraft 
space 
customization
building
open world
and more


things so far that i think you could be added 

ability to paint your star-ship
more companions
able to buy more star-ships if you have a freighter 
sometimes when you go to land the ship glitches and will hover over the area and you will have to reload 
able to customize and paint frigates 
and the ability to sleep and sit in chairs and beds 
beds when slept in should restore your life support

[u]Exploration[/u]: The strongest, and most enjoyable point of the game. You travel from system to system, with either a small ship or a capital ship, and [b]boldly go, where No Man has gone before[/b]. You can explore planets on foot, or by using one of the many avalible exocrafts. And you even explore underwater. 
There are so many systems in this game, you can be 100% sure, you will find many unexplored systems. 
[u]In Space[/u]: In space, well there is not that much to do. You can fight against pirates, be a pirate, mine in an asteriod field, stumble into some hidden things. And this is basically it. A bit empty.
[u]On Foot[/u]: On foot, well you are less limited. Exploring planets on foot (or in an exocraft) is a really fun adventure. Though after a while, it becomes repetitive. And the combat is kinda meh. Most of the enemies you can fight are sentinels, but after you know how to beat them they become a chore.
[u]Basebuilding[/u]: This is another fun part. You can build big, good looking bases. There are a lot of things to build. Though i miss some actually moving pieces. And doors that open and close, without having to build a complex circuit with switches.
Though there is one thing that is missing. Actual orbital and space stations that we can build. (Okay we have the capital ship, which is a moving space base, where we can build, but that is not the same).
[u]Multyplayer Content[/u]: This was a big surprise to me. When in single player mode i met people in the Anomlay, is just wow. Then i tried the Expedition mode, which is really fun and really good.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- GRAPHICS --[/b]
This game is absoultely beautiful. Flying around in space and looking around is just amazing. 
And on the ground, the planets look stunningly good. Especially those which are covered with unique flora and fauna. And they too look amazing.
[b]10/9[/b]

[b]-- BUGS --[/b]
Well, sadly there are a couple. The ones i found: texture bugs in exploration mode, especially on derelict freighters, crashes on death and the terrain likes to grow back into the buildings i build. And this lat, is pretty annoying.

[b]-- SOUNDS --[/b]
The sounds are really good. Sound engineers did a really good job on this. Music is a bit more generic, but still fits the game pretty well.
[b]10/9[/b]

[b]-- STORY --[/b]
Well, there is a minimal storyline in the game, but it is pretty forgettable.
[b]10/5[/b]

[b]-- NPC-s --[/b]
They are there. But they are really static. The only interesting thing about them, is to learn their language, word by word.
[b]10/6[/b]

[b]--TL;DR--[/b]
Taking everything into acccount NMS in 2021 is a really fun and enjoyable game. I hope they will put more content into it. And the new expedition mode, adds a lot to it. Let's just hope this will not turn into repetitive, with the same milestones in every 2 month.

Edit: I feel the need to write a real review. This game has one of those extremely rare feel-good comeback stories. A few years ago, like many people, I loved to hate on Sean Murray. Now I realize he was not a PR guy at all, he was the lead developer of a small team who built up way more hype than they were ready for. With no PR management, and a scope larger than they could really handle, the launch was a big disappointment. A lot of statements turned out to be unfeasible and the community took those as broken promises. I don't really blame the community for this. If you go on national television and claim something is in the game, it should be. So, I villainized Hello Games at the time. But since then they have done a phenomenal job of making up for it. They could easily have taken the money and run, but they put their nose to the grindstone and they turned it into a game I really enjoy. I now have a massive respect for Sean and Hello Games. I'm sorry for being a part of that toxic community at the time of release. I love exploring worlds, finding a crashed ship and restoring to its intended glory, taming pets, building bases, learning to communicate and trade with aliens, and even taking contracts for them. The combat, however, is relatively simple and isn't a big draw in my opinion. There are still ""broken promises,"" so to speak, but I think the features they've added that weren't even advertised more than make up for it. I plan on spending more and more time in this game, especially if I can get my friends to join me. Which yes, you can do that now!",1,1,2,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Tame creatures, work on getting a Living Ship, learn all words of a language, explore derelicts, follow the Expedition in this update including figuring out how to hang in the air for 30 sec and there's quite a bit more things to discover yet somehow all of it is just 'meh'.

I've had four characters across two versions of this game (Just a warning - get this version if you want to mod or edit saves. Game Pass version won't allow editing of the game files). This is part of the trifecta of good space games, and I love how it has a different feel than the other two. It's very quick to get in your ship and get going, and it's fun for casual play sessions as well as marathons. Some pros and cons, because you have to, right?

Pros:
-Beautiful, especially with the next-gen update and running on Ultra. Truly some amazing views.
-Procedural generation of planets and ships means you're unlikely to see the exact same thing twice
-Companions! You can finally tame that wildlife you see. It's not too useful, but a nice touch.
-Interesting story that is also entirely optional
-Truly a great community surrounds it
-Multiple galaxies of different types to explore, with millions of stars each. You'll never see it all.
-Creative mode for easy play, or you can mod for new content/QoL changes. You can even saveedit if you're a dirty cheater (but don't, though. It takes a lot of the fun out of it)
-Almost every resource can be harvested, but can also be bought in quantity once you have the green. DO THIS. You'll save hours harvesting materials by hand (especially di-hydrogen, which is very useful).
-Really good base building. I've seen some incredible designs (although all mine are boxes). You can have numerous bases, with teleporters linking them.
-You get to have a freighter, which is like a mobile base with tons of room to build, as well as hangar spots for all your ships. It also has a fleet of frigates you can use to do timed unattended missions for extra money/resources

Neutral
-A flight sim, this is not. Whether that's a pro or con is up to you. This is much more casual than Elite or SC. Personally, I play those games for the sim elements, so I'm okay getting in my ship and getting to orbit in ten seconds here.

Cons:
-You see soon enough that, while the universe is vast, there's not much point to it once you get far enough in.
-Finding exactly what you want can be a nightmare (thank god there's NMSCE)
-You can only have one freighter and six starships. Sounds like a lot, but you run out of slots pretty fast.
-Combat is a joke after the first few hours. Once you get S-class upgrades, there's not much to challenge you
-Those upgrades are expensive in rare materials, and don't transfer. So if you trade in your shuttle for that shiny new S-Class fighter, you're hunting all those upgrades again. Same applies for multi-tools (which is your do-everything weapon/tool)
-Money (as in credits) is SO easy to make. You'll be rolling in millions with minimal effort.
-Multiplayer is a bit wonky sometimes
-The game isn't terribly forthcoming with info. You'll be relying on reddit/wiki for a lot of info.

All in all, this is a very fun game, especially the first playthrough, and is a great game to put down and come back to after a few months. You'll get lost once again.

For being made by a small studio, No Man's Sky is a testament to how far a game can rise and how successful an initially poor product can come. I want to touch on a few things that stand out to me for the sake of this review, so I'm going to split it into positives and negatives.

Positives:
- The game let's you do whatever you want, you aren't locked into playing a certain way
- Expansive and dynamic solar systems, including rare resources, ecology and cross breeding/gene splicing
- Base building/exocraft construction
- Multiplayer nexus with daily missions for exclusive rewards
- Starship and multitool diversity and customization 
- Consistent update cycle

Negatives:
- Very repetitive gameplay loop
             > Get in ship, fly to planet, land, scan ecology, get in ship, fly to planet, etc
- Buggy 
             > Texture issues, saves being corrupted, random crashes are all still present after 5 years
- Not enough variation between planets
              > After you visit about 8 solar systems, you've seen every planet type

I really enjoy the game, but I've seen many of my friends leave the game after playing for about 10-15 hours because they find it too repetitive. I completed the main story in about 30 hours and after that the rest of the side quests feel very trivial by comparison. The recent expedition update provides a good way to get people to come back and earn rewards through gameplay, but there is still a while to go before No Man's Sky can truely become a self-sustaining game. If you really enjoy space/adventure games, this is going to be a great purchase.

DELETE my old review.

When i cant sleep i imagine im in a little bed-sized spaceship skipping around the galaxy. This is that. I was unsure at first. I invested some hours. I cherish every second bc it wont happen again. (which i guess is true of every instant to ever be). 

and that's kind of the deeper point of the game. on a meta level. i dunno. play it.

I wasnt sure if i liked it 
but within a few weeks (of saying ""i dunno if i like it [but putting in a hundred hours]) i aspired to beat it on Permadeath. im not a guy who normally cares about achievements. i did it to prove something to my spaceship-bed-lucid-dreaming-self.

there's been a lot of shit talked over the years but this game rocks.

297,76561198028313069,455,2,8347,8347,"I would first like to say I recognise that this game is far better now than it was on launch.  That said, it is still a deeply flawed (and at times frustrating) gameplay experience.

The progression in this game is deliberately obtuse, and will go out of its way to delay the player from actually achieving any progress.  This is done in a number of ways, such as;

Enforced timers on some main story missions.  Some mission's only objective is to play the game for ~1 hr 30 mins doing other things then come back - that is the only objective. Wait, and be delayed.  This is not engaging at all, and early in the game if you haven't found anything else to do this is very boring.

Massive RNG on upgrades.  Each space station has a random inventory of available upgrades for purchase.  With the variety of things you can upgrade, and that realistically you only use one multi-tool weapon type, duplicates and/or upgrades for things you do not need crop up.  A lot.  The only way to find new upgrades is to go to a new system.  In a game designed around exploring uncharted planets, if you want to actually get yourself upgrades to do this you're effectively encouraged to warp into a system, go to the station, check the vendors (and likely not find what you need) and then go to a new system to see if that station has what you want.  Highly off-putting when you want to actually explore the planets as you go, but feel like your equipment needs upgrading to do that much better/easier.

Living ships.  What would have otherwise been a fantastic update to give you an ""end-game"" shiny thing to chase, is instead a kick in the teeth.  You *must* purchase an item from a vendor in the ""multiplayer"" hub of the game using a currency only obtained (in sufficient quantity) from ""community missions"".  While you can technically do these on your own, they are designed for multiple people, so be prepared for a royal pain in the backside.  You cannot obtain the void egg from any other source, and if you didn't buy this game with the intent on playing with other people the fact this tries to ""encourage"" you to do this, and makes your life difficult if you do not, will probably leave a sour taste in your mouth.  It certainly did for me.

There are plenty of things to do, and lots of things have been added to the game since it was released, but they are all designed in such a way that they take as much of the players time as possible up, either by excessive grinding or arbitrary timers.  Add to that the fact that after you've been to half a dozen star systems the odds are you've seen everything the game has to offer, you'll be left wondering what exactly you'll do with whatever feature you're attempting to make use of.  You'll see the same plants, animals and even rocks on multiple planets, often back to back.  The buildings all have the same architecture, and look identical, just plopped down in the middle of nowhere, looking like it might as well be on the planet two star systems back.

TL:DR
These days this game is very wide, with lots of added ways to do the same thing.  Sadly, depth didn't get added along with them and what you're left with is a hollow grind that doesn't feel fun when you realise just how little variety there is on offer.",0,0,0,0.502340078353881836,0,True,False,False

299,76561197963136589,97,21,27708,27708,"Overall, everything is just ""meh"". For spaceship, you get a starter ship you probably won't like and instead of being able to change it's parts (AND COLOUR!!!) to the ones you would like to get different looks, stats and utilities, you need to jump from star system to star system hoping that this time you find one that has the mix of parts you like. It triggers me just thinking about it. You can't even get rid of your boring default armament to put in the weapons you want to actually use as default.

The space fights are pretty much all the same and ultra easy once you figure out how it works (as long as you are using a controller). Especially once you get good upgrades for your ship. just stock up on some nitrate and refill your shields before they break and you can go for hours. The most infuriating thing though is how spaceflight feels like atmospheric flight. as soon as you let go of the gas you loose all your speed, so no drifting or pivoting on yourself to shoot backward and other cool space flying manoeuvers. 

ground wise, you get told to destroy the sentinel before they call back up, but they call back up whatever you do even if you one tap them when they are not alerted. 

The creatures and planets are cool at first, but after a bit it starts to all look the same. There's a feeling like nothing is unique since everything is a mix of everything. Some plants and minerals are all the same yet every time you got to scan them to ""know"" what they are for every planet you visit.

It's fun at first, building a base, getting some ships and getting rich to get more stuff. once it's all done though, you got no other reasons to play. Unless you want to create yet an other cool base or whatever with some friends.

It's a decent non-serious game that would be ideal for young teenagers though. If you're an adult looking for some fun in space, I'd recommend looking for something else (I keep thinking I should've got elite dangerous instead).",0,0,1,0.502167463302612305,0,True,False,False

But after a couple of years, I started to see reports that were favorable about the No Man's Sky and so I looked further. Hello Games, no doubt, dropped the ball big time with this game, it was over hyped and they under delivered, badly. But what I started seeing was a company who created a series updates, not just patches, but actual game changing updates and the players were loving it. More importantly all these updates had been free. So I decided to wait for it be on sale and got it for $29.99 which i thought was an acceptable risk. i loaded up and played, keeping my fingers crossed. 

I was just blown away with game. Discovery, stories, space travel, build your own bases,combat, new worlds, aliens, puzzles, derelict ships, multiplayer, VR, just scratches the surface of what you do in this game. It is quite the experience.

321,76561198115146638,1620,63,601,601,"No Man's Sky has been on my radar since before it launched, in that notoriously botched state, back in 2016. As a space junkie, already sick and tired of waiting for Star Citizen to ever condense from vaporware to liquidware, I was hungry for some cool space exploration and trading game. No Man's Sky looked like it could be it. Then the ""event"" happened. No Man's Sky had a catastrophic launch, the game was a litany of broken promises and missing features that shocked the gaming world and a huge backlash followed. Of course, I had not pre-purchased this game, remember kids ""don't pre-purchase"", so for me it was just a matter of reading the reviews, sighing audibly and removing the game from my wishlist.

At that point, I thought that was the end for No Man's Sky. Indeed, if this was a typical gaming story it would have been. Many developers oversell their games, release them in sorry states with not even half the promised content and then run away with the dough Peter Molyneux-style. Indeed, Hello Games went silent for a while after the release, seemingly confirming the rule. But this game was to be an exception. The developer went silent because they had decided, finally, to let their actions do the talking. In the months and years that followed, they continued developing the game and without asking for extra money, they fixed most issues and added most of the missing features, plus many new ones. I was impressed.

Unfortunately, the game itself did not interest me as much anymore. Yes, I still love space, but No Man's Sky seemed to be primarily one of those pesky open-world/survival-crafting games. Between the release of No Man's Sky and today, I have been burnt too many times by such games to be able to ignore this. They usually lure me in by having traits I like, like being set in great worlds to explore, but their primary gameplay loop simply drains me. Use stuff to gather stuff, to be able to keep using stuff to gather stuff. It feels extremely disrespectful towards my relatively limited free time. But, because of the developer's conduct I bought the game anyway. Perhaps, I thought, the exploration/space part would be enough to offset this. It wasn't.

For people that do enjoy survival/crafting games, I think No Man's Sky has a lot to offer. There are several different types of worlds to travel to, filled with flora and fauna for you to name... and of course resources to gather, so you can travel to the next one. The player is initially very restricted, but as you build up your base and repertoire of known technologies to craft, more and more playstyles become possible. Trading, doing missions, multiplayer hubs, it's all there (at least now). On the other hand the exploration aspect doesn't disappoint. Amazing vistas, big underground caverns, extreme weather effects, space stations with several sapient alien species, speaking their own languages that you have to learn. Those are but a sample of the things on offer.

My playtime may have been rather short, but I did get some great moments out of this game. The first time I went to space, or landed on another planetary body. The first time I spoke to a Gek with their funny unintelligible language and even funnier faces. The first time I travelled through the rings of a planet. I do hope to play some more from time to time, when I feel less drained by the routine. At the end of the day though, I am content to admit that this game just isn't for me. I certainly don't regret buying it, the primary reason after all was to reward the developer for their recent conduct. Nevertheless, to fans of space games that also happen to enjoy the open-world survival/crafting gameplay loop, I can, in good conscience, recommend trying No Man's Sky.",1,259,4,0.871400237083435059,1,True,False,False

 I am in my later 20s, I've been a gamer since daipers, I understand gaming and geek culture on a intuitive level, and as such, I am no casual at games in general. But as of the last 5-6 years I have been getting driven away from video games. Industry practices such as micro transactions, unfinished/mediocre products demanding full price, loot boxes and games being brain drained to accomodate more....ahem....a more ""casual"" crowd....if your anything like me, you know immediately all the problems I am outlining and perhaps a few more I have not mentioned, but the point is, all of this, combined with my own increased responsiblity as a adult, have made me very disillusioned with a passion that was once central to my identity.

For a long while I begin to think if this was the direction games were going, then despite my entire life having been around this hobby, I was no longer going to be a gamer. I began to focus on real life much more and felt myself becoming like a typical boomer, simply scoffing at people who waste their lives playing these mediocre trash heaps that dare call themselves games today. I was done with games.

[b]But then I saw a video from the youtuber, Internet Historian...[/b]

A incredibly detailed essay of a small game developer, struggling to push out a ambitious game, and failing to meet the deadline. Being crucified for their failure. Bouncing back, staying strong, fixing their mistakes, turning it all around, and refusing to charge extra for it......it inspired me. So much so that I went and bought No Man's Sky right away. And at half price too !

[b]The game immediately impressed me[/b]

Not only did I like this game.....but it made me feel the heart throb of the type I have not felt since.....well...years. It made me feel again, what playing a good game is like. I do not have much time in my life but by god I spent as much of that time as I could diving into this well crafted masterpeice of a space exploration simulator. Traveling through warp space and arriving to the surface of a new planet, that feeling of mystique and wonder that it gives you, not knowing what you should expect, will you be eaten alive by carnivorous creatures, or greeted by beautiful and friendly lifeforms.

I cannot stress enough how jaded I am with video games. But this is a game where you buy it once, and are not charged for any extra content, and you get all updates for free. AND it is a good freaking game to boot. Trust me, if it can meet my standards and restore a jaded gamer into playing 22 hours in just a week, you might wanna give this one a try. In a landscape full of greedy devs who want every nickel, and for horrible products, No Man's Sky is a shining beacon, radiating it's light, obliterating the lies and deception of every other industry participant that had been fed to us over these years. If Hello Games can make this, then why are so many games these days so bad? There is no excuse.",1,172,6,0.836902618408203125,23,True,False,False

324,76561198070170524,164,32,3187,3187,"Tbh the first 20h I LOVED this game and for the rest of my playtime I tried to find that feeling again but just couldn't. As you progress you start to see the same planets, the same plants, the same ships, the same quests etc. 

Planets: They are beautiful and very large most of the time. The first planets you find are varied and very cool, but after only three star systems I started to see a massive reuse of everything. It started to look the same in every system.

Exploration: The exploration in this game is astounding and I got hooked very quickly, but I quickly stopped being hooked as well. You can find a bunch of different buildings. Abandoned buildings, observatories, construction sites, crashed freighters, alien ruins and varied small structures. Once you have discovered all of these you won't be interested in exploring for the mysterious feeling of finding something old or rare. It will eventually turn into exploring only to find materials and stuff to sell or to upgrade your stuff with. The plants you scan are cool at first but then the get put everywhere in the game, you will see at least 3-5 of the same plants on every planet with SLIGHT variations. They will count as different plants and that was confusing for me personally. Same goes for minerals, animals and the landscape.

Ships: They're basic to start with and you gradually work your way up to better ones. But as with everything else they start to look the same. There are different types of ships. Fighter, Explorer, Hauler, Shuttle, Exotic and Living ships. Sounds like a lot of ships but they are randomly generated with the same types of looks. You will not get a fighter and a hauler that looks the same or can be generated to look the same. But you will always get a hauler that looks similar to all other haulers. The same goes for all the other ships except for Exotics and living ships, but they are very late game or very expensive to buy when you first start.
You can find shipwrecks from distress calls that you can claim and repair to get a ship for free but instead you need to repair it which takes a lot of materials and a lot of time which kinda defeats the purpose imo.

Upgrading: You can upgrade almost everything you use. This process is very slow however. You'll get the option to buy one storage slot for your personal inventory per solar system. The price for the one slot upgrade gets a lot higher each time you upgrade. If you want to upgrade storage for your ship its even more expensive. Either you buy one for a few million up to 15+ millions or find a module that you can use to upgrade for free but they are very rare or endgame. A thing I noticed with the ship prices is that they're mostly determined by how many storage slots they have no matter if it's a hauler or a fighter. The rarity also plays a role but mostly the storage. 

Fighting: The on-foot fighting is bad, no other word for it. The ground gameplay isn't made for battle it's more like a battle can be fought if necessary but only that, so it's understandable. The space battles are fun and easy to understand, I think they really nailed the first and third-person views for the targeting systems. You can expect good gameplay from space battles.

Quests: The main story is tedious and confusing. You start with one quest that turns into two that share the same objective then they separate into different quests. You're not really sure what questline to follow and that's very annoying because you unlock crucial upgrades and base parts which they don't tell you about. The side quests are repeated as early as the first time you can accept them, I got the ""Kill 10 creatures"" from three different guilds (Merchant, Mercenary and Gek) from the same quest giver. You'll come across this in every system.   

Freighters: Freighters gives you the option to store up to six ships and gives you the ability to start missions that take care of them self. You also get to build and make changes to the interior of the freighter (not the command deck or color). 

Summary: It's a good game to start with but gets very repetitive. They've tried to make it look like more than it is.
1. If you're looking for a spaceship shooter game this is a great game.
2. If you're looking for a mysterious game with a lot to explore this is possible but VERY time consuming and repetitive.
3. If you're looking for a substitute for other ""space games"" this isn't it. It's one of a kind for good and bad reasons.
4. If you love the grind of collecting materials and building bases this game is perfect.

These are just my opinions of the game and you shouldn't let it make your decision if you want it or not. If you're unsure watch gameplays and make your own opinion about it. I felt like writing this review because I was very hyped but got very disappointed.

[h1]📑 Overview[/h1]
[i][b]This review contains no spoilers.[/b][/i]

No Man's Sky is a first-person or third-person (Camera type is hot-swappable) open-world survivalcraft game set in a sci-fi setting. The player takes control of an unnamed ""anomaly"" who wakes up on a hostile planet with no recollection of their origins. 

No Man's Sky has received a ton of controversy back when it was first released in 2016 due to unmet promises made during development. However, the game's developers, Hello Games, have proven to be extremely capable of revitalizing what seemed like a lost cause.

[h1]📖 Story[/h1]
The player awakens on a hostile planet and must quickly get their bearings before they are killed by the cold, heat, or radiation of the world they spawn in. After installing various technologies to help them traverse the alien landscape, the player is made aware of a distress signal, which strangely just repeats the same code: [16,16,16]. The player seems to be following the trail of a person who came long before them and soon takes to the stars in search of the origin of the signal. 

The story in No Man's Sky is clearly there to guide along the tutorial and propel player exploration, and it works fine in doing that. The story teaches the player important mechanics such as resource mining, material refinement, crafting, starship flight, and hyperwarping in a fairly intuitive and non-intrusive way. 

No Man's Sky is a sandbox game where you are supposed to make your own goals. The basic story gives the player an idea of what those goals can be, and keeps the game open ended enough that the player can ignore the story and just get right into the experience.

[h1]🎮 Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay in No Man's Sky is varied and wide-rangedl, but what you will be doing most of the time is flying in a starship between planets and other locations. I have to say that it's impressive how fun it is to control the starships. A lot of the starship's maneuvers feel really awesome to carry out. I haven't personally touched much of space combat, but from what I have experienced, it feels super cool to dodge asteroids and doing quick turnarounds to attack the enemy with laser cannons or missiles. It's just plain fun.

Another common thing you will be doing is exploring planets on foot. The movement speed of the player feels perfect, and there are other movement options to help the player to traverse the alien worlds. While exploring, the player will often find minerals or ore deposits that they will want to collect. This is where the multitool comes in -- the multitool works like a mining laser, terrain manipulator, or even a laser gun. Resource collection with the mining laser is satisfying and quick, and can be upgraded to be even quicker and reap more rewards. 

Exploration is the big draw to this game, and the various ways you can explore keeps the game fresh. Part of the reason why exploration feels really good is because you can name the things you can find. Most explorable things are randomly generated, which means that each planet is unique, and there will always be more stuff to find.

Combat appears pretty rarely unless the player decides to attack a creature without provocation. If you avoid sentinel-filled planets, you're generally gonna be pretty safe and not die often as long as you pay attention to your hazard protection. I'm fine with this, as ground combat outside of an exocraft is pretty mediocre. It's just hold left click on the enemy and don't get hit. 

There is just too much to talk about in regards to gameplay to fit in this review, but just keep in mind that there's almost always something to do. Whether you like trading, exploring, combat, or base building, there will always be some sort of task for you to pick up. However, No Man's Sky is all about creating your own goals. If you want a game that gives you a clear objective, this game is simply not for you. 

However, there is one facet of gameplay I have not gone over, and that is multiplayer. The concept behind No Man's Sky's multiplayer is that you can run into other players while exploring the universe. While that sounds cool, the universe in No Man's Sky is theoretically infinite. You could be online for thousands of hours, but there's almost zero chance you're going to naturally run into another player. You are also supposedly able to see what other people have named things that they have discovered, but I have had issues getting that to work properly, even when directly playing with some of my friends. On that note, directly joining a friend is basically just teleporting you to them in their session. There is no co-op element to the multiplayer. If that's not what you need, then the multiplayer will suit you: but I expected some semblance of co-op mechanics (like quest synchronization or a refined trading menu) and was disappointed. 

[h1]🕵 Audiovisuals and Performance [/h1]
Graphically, No Man's Sky is picturesque, despite being almost all randomly generated. There is a powerful photo mode, and at almost any time during the game you could open the photo mode and take a really nice picture with minimal effort. I played this game at the lowest settings, and the game still managed to put me in awe at some of its scenery. The animations for alien races are incredibly emotive, helping to make these fantastical alien species seem more real. 

The game performs okay but leaves a lot to be desired. While the overall game looks visually pleasing, the graphics themselves are not great if you look at them for too long. I feel that No Man's Sky is probably not the most well optimized and could look a whole lot nicer on lower end builds if some extra effort was put into optimizing it. 

The game is buggy sometimes, as well. The worst I have had is a broken main quest, where I had to use a save editor to move the quest forward. I was willing to do this, but most players will not be. Hello Games have been doing an amazing job at cleaning up this game, but the game is still not perfect in regards to bugs. However, the game is constantly being updated and these issues may be lessened in the future.

[h1]📗 Closing Opinions[/h1]
[b]FINAL VERDICT: GOOD[/b]
★★★★☆
No Man's Sky has made one heck of a comeback compared to how it was at launch and has plenty of content to play with as long as you are willing to make your own goals. The scenery is majestic, and the world feels real, with each planet managing to have its own personality in the literally infinite universe. However, the game is far from perfect. It's still filled with bugs, ranging from mild inconveniences that could probably be amusing, to game-breaking. The multiplayer also leaves a bit to be desired. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons in most respects, and No Man's Sky is a really fun experience that I could see people putting hundreds, if not thousands of hours into.",1,126,4,0.763566434383392334,2,True,False,False
327,76561198107346352,96,8,3703,3703,"I don't think anybody would deny that Hello Games deserves utmost commendation for their phenomenal dedication towards building their game up to be more in line with what they promised; this being said, No Man's Sky yet still struggles not to be a shadow of what it truly could be. Exploration becomes stale and unexciting after the first system or two. Planets, fauna, and flora end up all acting and looking nearly identical, despite being hundreds of star systems apart. Base building is fun but entirely inefficient and unfulfilling aside from storing items. Economy is pointless and easily exploited. Ruins, wrecks, and distress signals are unrewarding and lack any substance aside from material gain. Star-ships suffer a similar plague to the animals and plants, being that they all end up looking, feeling, and doing the same thing but have a different color or cockpit style. They're fun to collect, but with lack of both cosmetic and non-cosmetic customization and personalization, it's frustrating to wade in such an in-depth concept when it's stuck at such a shallow level.

What should be a reward for the curiosity of the player instead becomes 300 credits for ""discovering"" the exact same flower you've seen on the last three planets but happens to be of a different name. Plainly, there just isn't enough variation to overcome its platitudinous nature. With procedural generation being the culprit and the core of NMS, it is hard to overlook how glaringly bland the ""discovery"" aspect of this game still remains, five years later. The updates that Hello Games has released within the last couple of years are definitely interesting and exciting; doubtless, they are good content. However, the problem lies with the fact that these updates are great DLC additions to an average game, which hinders you from enjoying the newer content to the fullest extent due to the underlying game being lackluster. A car with the most exotic, most thrilling, and most beautiful of body designs amounts to nothing if the engine is insipid and problematic. 

I have nothing but respect for Hello Games and their ""actions>words"" mentality and approach. Maybe one day, they will give No Man's Sky the deep rethinking that it desperately needs to achieve what they first envisioned. Until then though, aside from a decent and aesthetically pleasing time waster, I cannot recommend NMS if you're looking for the ultimate space exploration experience that we all believed it would be.",0,0,13,0.736209750175476074,37,True,False,False

The game is not everyone's cup of tea, there are a lot of exploring loops, but beautifully crafted, interesting and unknown planets, buildings, ships and many more things will make it worth. There are many times I just got off my ship in awe for what I discovered.
There are a lot of walking and scanning and buying and selling and similar mechanics and game is definitely a tad frustrating at times but all of the above become more organic as you play and they integrate in how you want to play the game in your pace.
Base building is a bit bare bone compared to similar games, but you can surely build something to your liking. Aaaah, [b]devs[/b] please [u]stop[/u] people from building in view distance of your base (ruining your view with an unfinished ugly structure or blocking the view).

329,76561198052594067,46,5,7895,7816,"[b]NMS has lots of things to do, it is like a vast lake, but as soon as you go in, you realize it's only deep enough to wet your feet.[/b]

NMS has lots of mechanics, most of which are extremely shallow. There is a story, there is resource gathering, there is combat, there is resource gathering, there is exploration, there is resource gathering, there is equipment, there is resource gathering, there is base building and there is multiplayer. Oh, and also resource gathering.
Out of all of those the most fleshed out is - you guessed it - Base building. So let me go through those mechanics and how I feel about their implementation within the game one by one to give you an accurate idea of what you will be doing if you decide to spend your free time playing this game.

[h1]Resource Gathering[/h1]
Yes, playing NMS and trying to engage with most of the mechanics requires copious amounts of resource gathering, and all that gathering is in the game is shooting a laser beam at things until they die or get destroyed and those resources get transported to your inventory. Let me remark: all that is is staring at something with your button (mouse, controller, w/e) clicked, until it disappears. That's all. And you will have to do it all the time.
""There is no way that's all there is to it"", I hear you saying, and you are right, but that is about 95% of it. There are some other ways to get resources but you won't engage with those nearly as often.

[h1]Base Building[/h1]
Easily the best implemented mechanic in the game. You can go deep with this, and while there are some annoyances, you won't necessarily run into them often. There are lots of different assets for you to play with, and you can really get very creative with this mechanic. There are even assets for water submerged buildings! 
There are games that implement base building with a modular block system: You build rooms and may equip them but you don't design the shape of the room; think Subnautica, and there are base building implementations in which you have - or are encouraged - to build each room yourself, to your liking, and instead of rooms you manage floors, walls, roofs, etc; think Fallout 4. NMS has both of these systems, so you can get a quick setup going by using the modular rooms, or get really intricate and personal by chosing to design each room yourself. 
And the decoration has lots of options too! Chairs, tables, lockers, even flags; you name it, there are probably several options for you to chose from.

[h1]Space Exploration[/h1]
There is this persistent aspect to NMS which is procedural generation. When done right, procedural generation can be amazing. Here it is lackluster. There is a handful of planet archetypes; say radioactive, hot, cold, toxic, earth-like, etc. The first time you visit each of these archetypes, you will experience something relatively different to what you've seen before, and it will probably be exciting, but keep in mind the amount of assets for each planet is [b]very[/b] limited, say up to 20 plants, 20 creatures and 20 minerals, usually less than this, and you must keep in mind that a good portion of each of those are specific to each biome of the planet (water, simple surface, mountain surface or caves). So you will only experience a handful of those assets copy pasted over and over and over again. Some biomes are super similar independently of the planet archetype, like caves or water biomes, what will differ the most with each archetype are the surface biomes. Within each planet archetype, assets get heavily reused, and it's very noticeable.
Basically, as far as planet exploration goes you will have experienced all there is to it by the time you visit your second or third iteration of each archetype.
Other than planets, there are some other things to see in space: some story related entities, which always look the same inside and out, occasional frigate encounters, which look different in the outside but are all the same in  the interior, system space station which also are usually somewhat different on the outside, all the same in the interior, and the Space Anomaly, which is a multiplayer hub.

[h1]Combat and equipment[/h1]
There is combat when on a planet and combat in space. When in space, you will shoot ships with your own ship and get shot at. There are a few different weapons, but combat is so extremely unchallenging that you won't need to use anything other than your base weapon. If you do use something else, its all very similar: 
You can shoot explosives so you deal a large amount of damage in long intervals, or small amounts of damage in short intervals, or continuous laser beams which deal nearly continuous damage. The DPS is nearly the same, and nothing else really changes. 
Enemy ships will always react the same way to your attacks, and there is no other system that will intervene, like if the laser beam dealt more damage to the shield but less to the ship itself. In space there is only 1 type of enemy, which are simple ships, they can be pirates or sentinels but they act all the same.
Within a planet, there are a few more enemy variants. Sentinels, which are robotic creatures present in every planet, can be simple (floating) drones, dog-like 4 legged drones, and bipedal tall robots. The drones shoot small bullets at short intervals at you, they don't do much else other than that. They can have 1 health bar or 2 if they are 'armored'. The dog-like drones are all the same: they can jump at you for melee damage, or shoot a short lived continuous laser that follows your movement. They bipedal robot only shoots the laser akin to the 4 legged drone, but it will require you to use explosives to kill it as it has some more advanced armor.
Other than that, some planets have aggressive fauna, which means that the carnivours of that planet will attack you on sight, and that entails just jumping at your or biting you in melee range. There are also ""monstrosities"" at abandoned buildings, which can do the same as aggressive fauna, but also they throw some kind of acid bolts at you in a ranged sort of fashion.
That's all there is. Did you count? If you count the different types of damage/weapons you will be facing, there are about 5: Short interval burst of bullets, short lived continuous laser beams, jumping at you melee, close range melee, and a weird bolt. There is no variety or changes from enemy to enemy, those are carbon copies over and over, unlike a ranged enemy in, say, an FPS game which might have different types of projectile weaponry, which have different interval, damage, armor penetration, burst, etc, characteristics.
You can alter your stats, those of your ship or of your land vehicles through equipment. The equipment you can apply occupies slots where your gathered resources could go, which is a fun mechanic as you have to decide if you want to lose capacity in favor of  capability. Visually, nothing changes. The appearance of your character, your vehicles or your ships are independent of the equipment you have. If there was more of an RPG theme to this, and you could armor your character with different equipment that you could see and had different characteristics, that would be cool. Instead, all equipment does is alter some base stats, which means that you maybe will survive a couple of more enemy bullet bursts, or your enemies will survive a couple of bursts less from you... or, alternatively, your ship will move slightly quicker, or your jetpack will last slightly longer. That's about the depth of the equipment system, and that's disappointing.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
At the end of the day, NMS attempts to do a little of everything and ends up doing very little well. When you start playing and every mechanic and concept is novel, it's all very exciting, but as soon as you delve with each of those mechanics as they are presented you realize how shallow it all is.

330,76561198202701980,146,2,8890,8890,"This game has more long-term support than most phones get. I bought this game around the NEXT update, the first major overhaul to the game, right around when the reviews started shifting towards positive, and I enjoyed it a lot. To be honest, I thought I'd seen everything No Man's Sky had to offer.

I was completely wrong.

To be honest, I've completely lost count of the updates that Hello Games has launched over the years. The amount of content that's being added into the game FIVE years into its release is staggering. You can now explore a crashed freighter, create hubworlds for players to visit, start an MMO-like journey called ""Expedition"" mode with other players, which itself is a completely different gamemode than co-op.
We've also gotten several major graphical overhauls, new planet terrain generation and planet types, different star formations and a galactic trade network, and not to mention that VR-mode is INCLUDED, not considered a separate game. 

I wouldn't be surprised if this game was mistaken to be brand-new, because it sure feels like it is. If you want a huge, open-world survival experience, where you can leave after you've seen everything and come back 6 months later to somewhere between 2 and 3 updates, I'd recommend No Man's Sky. Hello Games has done an incredible job of keeping this game alive and well, and I look forward to seeing all of the great new updates yet to come.",1,38,1,0.710257232189178467,0,True,False,False

332,76561198095027549,200,47,7188,7188,"I had an extremely mixed experience with this game. There were many aspects of it that I really enjoyed, but there were also many areas that were irritating or frustrating, and the cons eventually overwhelmed the pros, leading me to give this game a negative rating.

The graphics for this game were quite impressive, for the most part. It usually looks quite good, with countless fascinating planets, cool ships, and a ton of different things to see and explore. The optimisations taken to allow such a vast universe to be rendered are quite apparent though, with obvious texture pop-in, very inconsistent framerates, and limited render distances, which did put a bit of a damper on the experience.

The story and lore were very interesting, and this was one of the parts of the game I enjoyed the most. However, this also had some major caveats, as much of the dialogue in this game was either in another language or was written in such a way that made it difficult to read. I wanted to know more about the universe of this game, but struggled to understand what was happening a lot of the time. Additionally, I was not impressed with the ending of the main quest (major spoilers ahead, so be wary). Once you finish the main quest, [spoiler]you are given the opportunity to start in a new galaxy. However, it isn't clear at all what the consequences of such a decision are. It turns out you spawn in an entirely new region of space, and while you keep your ship and freighter, all of your upgrades on your exosuit, ship, and multi-tool break, and you are only able to get back to your previous bases if you're able to teleport to them.[/spoiler] Being vague with such a major choice with absolutely no warnings about the consequences of your decision is just completely unacceptable, and left me feeling quite betrayed.

The gameplay is alright, but it gets very repetitive very quickly. Gathering resources is a chore, hostile creatures almost immediately became trivial to defeat, ship fights are usually fairly trivial as well, and base building would be cool if there weren't so many arbitrary restrictions on how things can be connected. I also tried the game in VR which would have been really cool, but the game didn't run very smoothly in VR and I got motion sick pretty quickly.

Despite everything I've mentioned up to this point, I probably would have given the game a positive review if it weren't for this game's horrendous stability. I honestly feel lied to, as I saw many reviews that stated that this game had improved greatly from it's horrendous state five years ago, and how it's actually a good game now, but my experience (and the experience of the three friends I played with) tells a different story:

[*] Bases were a nightmare to construct, as terrain edits didn't save properly, the requirements for building components was wildly inconsistent, and plants frequently respawned inside of bases.
[*] Workstation inventories (such as refiners) were frequently wiped, leading to loss of resources, and they often showed they were running when they weren't, or vice versa.
[*] Repairs sometimes inexplicably listed the incorrect materials to repair.
[*] Base computer quests constantly pointed to a different base computer, sometimes pointing to nowhere at all.
[*] Quest icons were sometimes duplicated, or rapidly flashed, making it difficult to navigate to them.
[*] Using the pulse engine was infuriating when multiple icons were in close proximity, as it was often impossible to target the correct one.
[*] The main quest become impossible to complete for me at one point, as the necessary items did not spawn.
[*] It was fairly easy to clip through some objects and fall through the surface of the planet.
[*] Terrain editing was very inconsistent, as it didn't work if you were too close to the ground, terrain could break through other terrain, and breaking terrain sometimes created holes in the ground texture.
[*] Some buildings and landmarks spawned far in the air, while other spawned below what could be mined.
[*] Animals and sentinels sometimes clipped through objects while in dialogue.
[*] Ships sometimes got stuck inside a freighter after exiting a pulse or stuck inside a planet after using a star chart while flying towards one, with no way to escape.
[*] Ships sometimes inexplicably exited a pulse, drastically extending the time it took to fly somewhere.
[*] NPCs sometimes spawned at a 45 degree angle or inside the ground, and trying to talk to them in this state softlocked the game.
[*] Bases didn't sync properly between multiple players, and my friends often clipped through parts of the base or were stopped by things that didn't exist.
[*] My friends randomly got dropped from our group without reason, which also prevented them from getting the rewards for quests in progress, and these quests often didn't sync up properly, requiring steps to be completed multiple times.
[*] Some sound effects were extremely loud and were much louder than the rest of the game.
[*] Crashes to desktop occurred, although infrequently.

I continued to try to give this game more chances, as I did enjoy the game for the most part, but as more and more bugs were discovered, I simply couldn't enjoy the experience. The final nail in the coffin for me was when a bug occurred in the main quest, and it became impossible to complete. The only way I found to solve this was to use an external utility to edit the save and skip that step in the quest, which took a number of hours to figure out. After this I simply couldn't bring myself to give this game any more of my time.

[b]TL;DR[/b] While this game shows a lot of promise and has certainly improved in recent years, the poor communication of the story and lore (especially the ending), the repetitive gameplay, and the massive number of bugs and issues encountered lead me to avoid recommending this title.",0,0,7,0.680037140846252441,0,True,False,False

As one of the players from the release date of the game years ago, experiencing lots of ""ups and downs"" with this game... In its current state however with all the free updates and continued development over the years, if the game is [ON SALE] and you might enjoy it, then why not give it a shot!



---[Review]---

Being there playing release VS its current state is crazy to think about (50% Unplayable, save corruptions and extreme amount of missing content...
However this is now the game that was hoped for looking back at what they said should be in the game unfortunately it took a very long time to get here! 

What you'll find now is a decent game, Its not a ground breaking title by today's standards but its one to remember. There's plenty to have a go at if you enjoy exploring for the sake of it, I tend to find No Mans Sky relaxing with a bit of spiciness thrown in occasionally but there are a few things that might feel a bit repetitive for most players the longer one plays...

However being able to go solo then drop in at any time to a friend is great!

I would imagine not everyone will enjoy this game, but on the other hand many still could in its current updated state.

Will admit though the standard price of $80 AUD is extremely high, as lets be serious, its a older release now (late 2016) and its had its challenges in the past... Would strongly suggest picking up ON SALE! 
As of current review (6/4/2021) the game is half the price above, a lot more sensible.

Anyways playing it again, I'm enjoying it so decided to finally review it 5 years later ahaha.


NB: Thankfully the dev team has kept determined working on it, updating and adding large chunks of gameplay rather than ditching development and diving away from No Mans Sky!",1,6,0,0.603866636753082275,0,True,False,False

Framerates are good, solid 60fps for me, no stuttering, very smooth, and bugs are very rare. The planets are amazing to explore, lots of variety and excitement to be had.

NMS is basically space Minecraft, focusing a bit more on exploration. Would recommend if you like sandbox and exploration.  

Since the map is procedurally generated, most of the planets can feel a bit shallow. I've encountered a few bugs here and there, though some of them can be game-breaking (terrain magically growing back, softlock quest). Not sure if it's fixed by now. ",1,4,0,0.572076916694641113,0,True,False,False
342,76561198128235014,87,11,641,638," No Man’s Sky has come a long way since it was first announced and released. It started out as a basic space game with limited gameplay. It has since become a much better game. It is mostly as open world space game (PVE) with some co-op. Since the original release, the game has improved significantly. They have flushed out the “story” and main quest line. Added base building and economy. The game has a decent amount of replay ability. 
This game is very progression based. Once you finally complete all the objectives, build all the bases you wanted, explored lots of planets, it can become stale. This fact is overshadowed, however by the updates to the game that add more content. These updates decrease this problem significantly. 
Overall, this game is very polished and feels mostly complete. The planets and biomes look stunning and full of life on earthly planets and completely dead on others. There is a wide variety of places you can go with little restriction. You can even name planets and solar systems! This game has risen to my favorite space game overall. 

Pros: 
-Interesting worlds and biomes promote exploration
- Objectives teach you how to play the game 
-Easy to learn 
-Crafting items and mining are fun and easy to do
-Local economy makes mining interesting 
-Based building allows you to make a variety of builds
-Easy and stable to run (ran on nividia 1060 and got 100+ fps)
-no DLC (everything in base game) 
-no microtransactions

Cons: 
-Heavily progression based (once you complete everything, explore enough, get all ships: it can get stale)
-gameplay is a bit repetitive (when mining) 
-early mining and inventory management are challenging
-low amount of combat 

TL:DR If you are looking for a space game this is it. It is similar to space engineers, but simpler and easier to understand. A beautiful game to look at and co-op is not forced on the player. Overall, a great game and I highly recommend you play it. However, I would recommend waiting for a sale as $60 is a bit steep for a 1- year old game.

If you like Minecraft and think your computer can run a much more demanding game then yes, this is worth a shot.

What to expect:
 -Tutorial will NOT hand hold you (the more you explore the more the database grows in knowledge)
 -Death happens, and like Minecraft, you respawn and grab your stuff back and get back to it
 -You are not the top of the food chain (Sentinels and certain animals exist)
 -The wiki and in-game database will be ultimately be the difference in rage-quiting early or enjoying this game
 -This game is all about exploration, the more you explore the more fun, and calming (in a way) this game will feel
 -Exploitation of any given planet is a bit challenging right now so if you are an industrialist try Factorio or Dyson sphere program as the current system along with how the game runs is more geared to smaller bases for quick visits

Do you yearn for exploration? When you play a new game, do you canvas the entire map looking for interesting things? Do you only get a dopamine rush from seeing something in a game that you have never seen before?

If you said yes to these questions, then this game is perfect for you.

The early game is a little rough, but once you get a decent amount of income, the game really opens up with the amount of things you are able to do.

My main gameplay tips:
- You should try to finish the first part of the main story as quickly as possible, because it opens up a lot of the other mechanics in the game.
- Get a lot of salvaged data and make a base with unlocked parts as soon as possible. Having a base will let you dig for deep mineral deposits or farm, which can quickly make you A LOT of money.
- Upgrade your scanner on your multitool with three S-class upgrades. Doing this, if you're lucky with the upgrade rolls, can mean that scanning a single new creature on a planet will give you ~500,000 units in one go.
- Try to mostly visit systems that have a three-star economy. You can buy and sell goods for better prices there, you will get more valuable ships there, and potentially more valuable multitools.
- Because this game can seem pointless if viewed from a big picture perspective, try to alternate what you do every time you play. One day you can set up a deep mineral extraction mine, the next day clear out some desolate freighters, the next day talk to a bunch of Korvax to fill out your lexicon, the next day fly around looking for a better ship, etc. This way you won't get bored, at least not until you hit 200+ hours.

I'll end by saying that this game is not for everyone. Hell, I take months-long breaks from it and return once in a while to try out new content and do some relaxing exploration.

I had played for roughly 60 hours before putting it back on the virtual shelf. Back then the game was beautiful.

I just picked it up to play something new, and different. I was bored out of my mind when I played the initial release, and shelved it for a little while.

We all know the NMS story from there. 

NMS after Hello Games put some more work into her went from bland, and boring to ""pretty damn good"". The addition of a ""story"" helped. When i replayed NMS after a few content updates, I actually grinded it out to complete the story. It seemed the more content Hello Games put into NMS the better it became.

The good:  It's pretty. For the most part NMS has some good eye candy. Game play is simple, but immersive enough. For me when i play i just want to kick back, and enjoy the views. Base building can be fun. Creative mode is there for those that hate grinding. For the most part i just free roam. Once you get a decent enough ship, and suit upgrades you pretty much are not bound by anything.

The Bad: Things can get repetitive at times. Especially while questing, and mining. As i said, The game play is simple. Usual fetch this, or kill that quests. On top of grinding to improve your ship, and suit. Some effects break immersion. I get that its randomly generated, but it suffers sometimes from Homeworlds ""Space is Yellow"". Don't get me started on the hyperspace effect. Good thing there are mods that fix this.

This game allows it to play it as you please. If you want to be an explorer, you are rewarded. If you want to be a bounty hunter, you are rewarded, etc. Anything you do in the game progresses you forward in a very entertaining way. I am fairly early game, but it feels like a very complete game already.
The bad:
Glitches are not rare. Note that I do not say they are frequent or common. You're able to go down some story lines without completing the one that comes before it, leading to you getting half way through the new story and you cannot complete it because it just stops functioning properly due to not having completed prior parts. In addition, I have had a base in a location for some time, collecting resources from the area frequently. At some point, the trees decided that they were only present in a visible form that you can walk through and cannot use a mining laser on.
Summary:
There are few but occasional glitches in the game, one that I have encountered being game altering. This game always has a mission for you to do and missions often cross over into each other, giving you a dynamic experience that allows you to discover multiple things in a single mission so that you are never left underwhelmed or bored with the trip.

the largest and most customization in this game from your looks to your ship and more love how you can build bases 

there are bugs but very well made game if you like the following: 

Minecraft 
space 
customization
building
open world
and more


things so far that i think you could be added 

ability to paint your star-ship
more companions
able to buy more star-ships if you have a freighter 
sometimes when you go to land the ship glitches and will hover over the area and you will have to reload 
able to customize and paint frigates 
and the ability to sleep and sit in chairs and beds 
beds when slept in should restore your life support 


this is just my opinion so far as of today

[u]Exploration[/u]: The strongest, and most enjoyable point of the game. You travel from system to system, with either a small ship or a capital ship, and [b]boldly go, where No Man has gone before[/b]. You can explore planets on foot, or by using one of the many avalible exocrafts. And you even explore underwater. 
There are so many systems in this game, you can be 100% sure, you will find many unexplored systems. 
[u]In Space[/u]: In space, well there is not that much to do. You can fight against pirates, be a pirate, mine in an asteriod field, stumble into some hidden things. And this is basically it. A bit empty.
[u]On Foot[/u]: On foot, well you are less limited. Exploring planets on foot (or in an exocraft) is a really fun adventure. Though after a while, it becomes repetitive. And the combat is kinda meh. Most of the enemies you can fight are sentinels, but after you know how to beat them they become a chore.
[u]Basebuilding[/u]: This is another fun part. You can build big, good looking bases. There are a lot of things to build. Though i miss some actually moving pieces. And doors that open and close, without having to build a complex circuit with switches.
Though there is one thing that is missing. Actual orbital and space stations that we can build. (Okay we have the capital ship, which is a moving space base, where we can build, but that is not the same).
[u]Multyplayer Content[/u]: This was a big surprise to me. When in single player mode i met people in the Anomlay, is just wow. Then i tried the Expedition mode, which is really fun and really good.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- GRAPHICS --[/b]
This game is absoultely beautiful. Flying around in space and looking around is just amazing. 
And on the ground, the planets look stunningly good. Especially those which are covered with unique flora and fauna. And they too look amazing.
[b]10/9[/b]

[b]-- BUGS --[/b]
Well, sadly there are a couple. The ones i found: texture bugs in exploration mode, especially on derelict freighters, crashes on death and the terrain likes to grow back into the buildings i build. And this lat, is pretty annoying.

[b]-- SOUNDS --[/b]
The sounds are really good. Sound engineers did a really good job on this. Music is a bit more generic, but still fits the game pretty well.
[b]10/9[/b]

[b]-- STORY --[/b]
Well, there is a minimal storyline in the game, but it is pretty forgettable.
[b]10/5[/b]

[b]-- NPC-s --[/b]
They are there. But they are really static. The only interesting thing about them, is to learn their language, word by word.
[b]10/6[/b]

[b]--TL;DR--[/b]
Taking everything into acccount NMS in 2021 is a really fun and enjoyable game. I hope they will put more content into it. And the new expedition mode, adds a lot to it. Let's just hope this will not turn into repetitive, with the same milestones in every 2 month.

Edit: I feel the need to write a real review. This game has one of those extremely rare feel-good comeback stories. A few years ago, like many people, I loved to hate on Sean Murray. Now I realize he was not a PR guy at all, he was the lead developer of a small team who built up way more hype than they were ready for. With no PR management, and a scope larger than they could really handle, the launch was a big disappointment. A lot of statements turned out to be unfeasible and the community took those as broken promises. I don't really blame the community for this. If you go on national television and claim something is in the game, it should be. So, I villainized Hello Games at the time. But since then they have done a phenomenal job of making up for it. They could easily have taken the money and run, but they put their nose to the grindstone and they turned it into a game I really enjoy. I now have a massive respect for Sean and Hello Games. I'm sorry for being a part of that toxic community at the time of release. I love exploring worlds, finding a crashed ship and restoring to its intended glory, taming pets, building bases, learning to communicate and trade with aliens, and even taking contracts for them. The combat, however, is relatively simple and isn't a big draw in my opinion. There are still ""broken promises,"" so to speak, but I think the features they've added that weren't even advertised more than make up for it. I plan on spending more and more time in this game, especially if I can get my friends to join me. Which yes, you can do that now!",1,1,2,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Explore where you want and rename your discoveries, I discovered a system where the default name would probably not pass the profanity filters here. Tame creatures, work on getting a Living Ship, learn all words of a language, explore derelicts, follow the Expedition in this update including figuring out how to hang in the air for 30 sec and there's quite a bit more things to discover yet somehow all of it is just 'meh'.

Still recommend it when it's on sale.

I've had four characters across two versions of this game (Just a warning - get this version if you want to mod or edit saves. Game Pass version won't allow editing of the game files). This is part of the trifecta of good space games, and I love how it has a different feel than the other two. It's very quick to get in your ship and get going, and it's fun for casual play sessions as well as marathons. Some pros and cons, because you have to, right?

Pros:
-Beautiful, especially with the next-gen update and running on Ultra. Truly some amazing views.
-Procedural generation of planets and ships means you're unlikely to see the exact same thing twice
-Companions! You can finally tame that wildlife you see. It's not too useful, but a nice touch.
-Interesting story that is also entirely optional
-Truly a great community surrounds it
-Multiple galaxies of different types to explore, with millions of stars each. You'll never see it all.
-Creative mode for easy play, or you can mod for new content/QoL changes. You can even saveedit if you're a dirty cheater (but don't, though. It takes a lot of the fun out of it)
-Almost every resource can be harvested, but can also be bought in quantity once you have the green. DO THIS. You'll save hours harvesting materials by hand (especially di-hydrogen, which is very useful).
-Really good base building. I've seen some incredible designs (although all mine are boxes). You can have numerous bases, with teleporters linking them.
-You get to have a freighter, which is like a mobile base with tons of room to build, as well as hangar spots for all your ships. It also has a fleet of frigates you can use to do timed unattended missions for extra money/resources

Neutral
-A flight sim, this is not. Whether that's a pro or con is up to you. This is much more casual than Elite or SC. Personally, I play those games for the sim elements, so I'm okay getting in my ship and getting to orbit in ten seconds here.

Cons:
-You see soon enough that, while the universe is vast, there's not much point to it once you get far enough in.
-Finding exactly what you want can be a nightmare (thank god there's NMSCE)
-You can only have one freighter and six starships. Sounds like a lot, but you run out of slots pretty fast.
-Combat is a joke after the first few hours. Once you get S-class upgrades, there's not much to challenge you
-Those upgrades are expensive in rare materials, and don't transfer. So if you trade in your shuttle for that shiny new S-Class fighter, you're hunting all those upgrades again. Same applies for multi-tools (which is your do-everything weapon/tool)
-Money (as in credits) is SO easy to make. You'll be rolling in millions with minimal effort.
-Multiplayer is a bit wonky sometimes
-The game isn't terribly forthcoming with info. You'll be relying on reddit/wiki for a lot of info.

All in all, this is a very fun game, especially the first playthrough, and is a great game to put down and come back to after a few months. You'll get lost once again.

For being made by a small studio, No Man's Sky is a testament to how far a game can rise and how successful an initially poor product can come. I want to touch on a few things that stand out to me for the sake of this review, so I'm going to split it into positives and negatives.

Positives:
- The game let's you do whatever you want, you aren't locked into playing a certain way
- Expansive and dynamic solar systems, including rare resources, ecology and cross breeding/gene splicing
- Base building/exocraft construction
- Multiplayer nexus with daily missions for exclusive rewards
- Starship and multitool diversity and customization 
- Consistent update cycle

Negatives:
- Very repetitive gameplay loop
             > Get in ship, fly to planet, land, scan ecology, get in ship, fly to planet, etc
- Buggy 
             > Texture issues, saves being corrupted, random crashes are all still present after 5 years
- Not enough variation between planets
              > After you visit about 8 solar systems, you've seen every planet type

I really enjoy the game, but I've seen many of my friends leave the game after playing for about 10-15 hours because they find it too repetitive. I completed the main story in about 30 hours and after that the rest of the side quests feel very trivial by comparison. The recent expedition update provides a good way to get people to come back and earn rewards through gameplay, but there is still a while to go before No Man's Sky can truely become a self-sustaining game. If you really enjoy space/adventure games, this is going to be a great purchase.
